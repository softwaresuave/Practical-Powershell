# The Powershell Playground contains a variety of Powershell programs for System Administrators!

Welcome...

These POWERful tools are meant to make your job easier, automating cumbersome processes.


Most of these scripts are arragned to run on remote machines that have their computer name/ ip address included in a computers.txt file, which is defined by the $Computers variable. Be sure to check the path & computer names before executing. This .txt file cannot have trailing whitespace after the last hostname. 


Be sure to enable scripting on your machine using the cmd: <br/> 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
