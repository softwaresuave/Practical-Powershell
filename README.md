# The Powershell Playground contains a variety of Powershell programs for System Administrators!

Tools for administrators to run various functions from a machine. Making your job easier, automating cumbersome processes.


TO EXECUTE  --  open Windows Powershell ISE as Administrator  >  open desired script  >  run and follow console prompts.

An explanation of each script is at the top of each script or commented in the code.

Most of these scripts are designed to run on remote machines that have their computer name or ip address listed in a computers.txt file, which is defined by the $Computers variable. <br/>
Ensure that both the path to the .txt that this variable is pointed to is valid, as well as the computer names within it. The computers.txt file cannot have trailing whitespace after the last hostname that is listed. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enable scripting on your machine by entering the below command in the PS console before execution: <br/> 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
