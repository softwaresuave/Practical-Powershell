# The Powershell Playground contains a variety of Powershell programs for System Administrators!

Welcome...

These POWERful tools are meant to make your job easier, automating cumbersome processes.


Most of these scripts are arragned to run on remote machines that have their computer name/ ip address included in a computers.txt file, which is defined by the $Computers variable. Be sure to check the path this variable is pointed to & computer names in the .txt file before executing. This .txt file cannot have trailing whitespace after the last hostname. 


Be sure to enable scripting on your machine by entering the below command in the PS console before execution: <br/> 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
